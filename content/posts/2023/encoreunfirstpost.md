Hello,

I hope you can read this. If yes, it means I successfully created my personnal blog. If not, then why am I writing this ?

This website has a few goals :
- Being a front door to my online presence ;
- To share my knowledge about work/ my passions or hobbies ;
- To be an easy to maintain, free way of expression and exchange with you ;

If you stumbled upon this post/ website not knowing why or how, I advise you go back to the homepage. Click a few buttons, explore the world around. This is a safe place here :-) 

Expect a bit of engineering sometimes, I like the "fuck around, and find out" approach and the why, the who, what, when, the where, and the how, until I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearing it out.
